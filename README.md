## What is the Content Tuner?

The **Content Tuner** is a lightweight Python tool that “tunes” text like a sound engineer tunes audio.  
It doesn’t generate new content—it compresses and sharpens what’s already there.

- **Profiles:** Pre-set tone and clarity profiles (`twitter`, `academic`, `investor`, etc.).  
- **Transforms:** Removes filler, expands contractions, compresses sentences, and adjusts tone.  
- **Metrics:** Shows placeholder values for `κ` (stress) and `ε` (entropy), hinting at deeper signal metrics.  

This is the **first proof-of-concept** built on a universal compression framework (ULT), which can tune not just text, but any signal-based system.
