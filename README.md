# Content README for Content Tuner
This is the prototype engine for tuning AI-generated content to match a specific voice, tone, or narrative style.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to explore how AI can be fine-tuned or post-processed to create coherent, emotionally resonant, and structurally sound writing—without needing the original author to rewrite it all by hand.

## Philosophy

This project is based on the idea that *voice tuning* will be a core primitive in AI-native tooling—especially for writers, strategists, and cultural architects.

## Status

This is a sketch-level prototype. It's not yet a full product, but it outlines how voice models could be tuned dynamically from prompt-level compression.
